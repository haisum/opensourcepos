This fork is modified version of opensourcepos. This fork was customized for managing a small pharmaceutical shop. Following customizations were done:
- Trade Price in addition to cost price and retail price was added to items section.
- Prices in Sales Register can be switched to Retail or TP by clicking T or R link below the price input box
- Sales Receipt was simplified to include discount as a column and remove barcode, cash due and return policy etc.
- New Item form has Trade Price input field. 

Note: Please set custom1 field to "Trade Price" in config section to make it appear in item form
